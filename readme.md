# Detecting Moving Objects Using Gaussian Mixed Model


In this work a typical cctv footage of cars passing through a highway is being used. 
Using Open-CV module we have built foreground detector using gaussian mixed model subtractor.


# To install opencv module Run the Following Commands

pip install opencv-python

# Instructions To Run

1) Download the notebook into a folder where you have your videos.
2) Edit the inputFile variable to your corresponding file name.
3) Edit the outputFile variable to create foreground detected video in that name.
